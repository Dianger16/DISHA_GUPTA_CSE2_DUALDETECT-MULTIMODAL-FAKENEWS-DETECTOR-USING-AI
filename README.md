DESCRIPTION :- **üîç Project Title:** *Multimodal Fake News Detector using AI*

**üìÑ Description:**  
A web-based application that detects fake news by analyzing both **text** and **image** inputs using **AI-powered models**.
 It combines an LSTM-based text classifier and a CNN-based image classifier to provide accurate predictions, enhancing reliability through multimodal verification.
 Built using Flask, this project offers a user-friendly interface and real-time results.

TECH USED AND STEPS TO RUN THE PROJECT:-
Frontend:HTML for structuring the web page.CSS for styling.
JavaScript for handling user interactions and sending data to the backend.
Backend:PythonFlask: A web framework for handling API requests.TensorFlow/Keras: For the image analysis model.
Scikit-learn: For the text analysis model.PIL (Pillow): For image processing.Tools:Git: For version control.A Text Editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
Conda or venv (recommended): For creating virtual environments.Steps to Run the Project:Clone the repository:git clone https:https://github.com/Dianger16/DISHA_GUPTA_CSE2_DUALDETECT-MULTIMODAL-FAKENEWS-DETECTOR-USING-AI
cd your-project-name

Install backend dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt
Download/Set up the models:Ensure that the text model (text_model.h5), the image model (image_model.h5), and the TF-IDF vectorizer (tfidf_vectorizer.pkl) are located in the models directory.
If you have trained your own models, place them in the correct directory.
  If you need sample models, you may need to download them from a separate location or generate them.
Run the Flask backend:python app.py
The backend server will start running at http://0.0.0.0:5000.Open the frontend:Open the index.html file in your browser.
Use the application:The "Fake News Detector" web application should now be running in your browser.
Enter the text of a news article, upload an image, and click "Detect Fake News".The results will be displayed on the page.
